# scraping8086

The intel 8086 8088 primer book bt stephen morse is available at https://stevemorse.org/8086/.

I developed this algorithm with the help of [Automate the boring stuff: chapter 12](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter12/) that scraps the images from stephen's web site and compiles it into a pdf.
